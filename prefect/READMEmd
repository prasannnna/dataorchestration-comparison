##  How to Run Prefect Pipeline

### Step 1: Start the Prefect container

```bash
docker-compose up
```
### The container:

- Installs dependencies

- Executes the Prefect flow

- Exits after successful completion

### Retry Configuration
- Retries are configured at the task level using decorators:

```
@task(retries=2, retry_delay_seconds=10)
```
- Retries are triggered only when a failure occurs.
- In the provided execution, all tasks succeeded on the first attempt.

### Execution Evidence
### Execution logs show:

- Flow creation

- Task execution order

- Successful completion of extract, transform, and load steps

- Logs are captured using:

```
docker logs prefect
```

### Note on Retries

Retry logic is configured at the task level using the `@task` decorator.
Retries are triggered only when a task fails.  
In the captured execution, all tasks succeeded on the first attempt, so no retry was required or triggered.

The retry configuration is visible in the pipeline code.


### Stop Services
```
docker-compose down
```
